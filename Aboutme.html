<p>My idea of Robotics didn't change. Innovations in robotics will better the lives of the handicaped and also make the lives of humans much easier to live in this earth. As a result the economy can improve from robotics. Nervous that humans will grow depenedant of robots and wont be able to function without them.</p>
<p>Manuela Veloso's work of robots playing soccer is similar to Ayanna Howard's arm sensory robot because they have senses of touch and there are useful for being aware of surroundings. Ms. Howard's work is also on Mars, she helped understand the mystery of Mars by enabling us to view what the robot can on the Mars' rover.</p>
<p>The team works together and improves our knowledge of what we know. Esha made sure that Tyler, Robin, and I understood. She used her physics knowledge to help us understanding Arduino.</p>
  <p>The basic pieces of every Arduino sketch is the understanding the circuits behind the robots.</p>
